## STRUCTURE

The present repository contains the following four folders:

### Data

Contains the raw data used for the SPDs, the data after filtering the .csv files and data generated under different assumptions. 

### Figures

Contains the figures used in the paper. These can be generated again using the script `04.Plots.R`.

### Results

Contains the results. Although the user can run the model again, if it wants to observe the results it will be faster to do it from here (see below).

### Scripts

The scripts used for the paper. These can be conceived as follows:

`01_Functions.R`
Contains all the necessary custom functions and (most) necessary packages to run the rest of scripts

`02*_data.R`
These generated the simulated data and prepare and filter the observed data according to the criteria specified in the main manuscript.

`03*ABC_*.R`
The scripts where the model is done. They retrieve the data from the structured folders and produced in the scripts above.

`04_Plots.R`
Produced the plots seen in the paper. It `sources` the functions and data from the previous scripts.

## REPRODUCIBILITY

In order to develop all the simulations (including the simulated dataset, as well as the dataset for Japan, Denmark and Iberia), it has taken us roughly a month computing in parallel with 50 cores. For a quick reproducibility check, the user must change change some lines in the code. Please note that this will not give good nor reliable results, but it can be used to make sure that the code works before launching more time consuming simulations.

In order to do this, the user must change the following, at the `03.1_ABC_Simulated.R` script:

- Line 26: Reduce the number of simulations for the object `sim`. 
- Lines 49-50: Either eliminate the loop to randomise the start or decrease strongly the number of iterations (perhaps `n_sim <- c(1:2)`?)
- Line 141: Set the desired number of cores. Personal computer will not have 50 cores.
- Line 207: Reduce the number of particles (perhaps `part_sim <- 500`?)
- Line 217: Set one single stage with while `(n_theta <= 1)`

This will only produce a ver small number of (non-usable) simulation, but concluding this garantees that the code works and the user can then set higher values to send to a computer cluster. 

If the user wants to try two or more particles, but still compute fast(ish), it will have to change the `line 203` and set a very high threshold. Too low unassessed thresholds might result in the stuck of the algorith, since in the parallelisation the model might never be able reach those values (hence using quantiles here).

If the user wants to do the same operation with the scripts `03.1_ABC_Observed.R` the protocol is the same, althgough the numbers of the lines can vary slightly.
